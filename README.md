## **🚀 Golang Roadmap: From 0 to Hero**

### **📌 Phase 1: Getting Started (Week 1-2)**
**Goal:** Understand the basics and setup your development environment.

❌ Install Go and set up your workspace
❌ Learn about Go's module system (`go mod init`, `go get`)
❌ Write a simple "Hello, World!" program
❌ Learn about variables, constants, and data types
❌ Understand functions, conditionals (`if`, `switch`), and loops (`for`)
❌ Explore Go’s unique approach to error handling (`error` type)
❌ Play around with Go Playground ([play.golang.org](https://play.golang.org))

📚 **Resources**:
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org)
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

### **📌 Phase 2: Intermediate Golang (Week 3-4)**
**Goal:** Learn Go's data structures, interfaces, and memory management.

❌ Structs & Methods
❌ Understanding interfaces and type assertions
❌ Working with slices, maps, and pointers
❌ Working with files (`os`, `io`)
❌ JSON encoding & decoding (`encoding/json`)
❌ Writing unit tests with the `testing` package

📚 **Resources**:
- [Go Wiki: Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

🚀 **Project:**
- Create a **JSON API** that reads and writes data to a file.

---

### **📌 Phase 3: Concurrency & Performance (Week 5-6)**
**Goal:** Understand goroutines, channels, and performance optimization.

❌ Goroutines (lightweight threads)
❌ Channels (for inter-goroutine communication)
❌ `select` statement (handling multiple channels)
❌ `sync` package (mutex, wait groups)
❌ Context (`context` package for timeouts and cancellations)
❌ Memory management & escape analysis

📚 **Resources**:
- [Go Concurrency Patterns](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-patterns-timing-out-and)

🚀 **Project:**
- Build a **web scraper** that fetches data concurrently from multiple sources.

---

### **📌 Phase 4: Web Development & APIs (Week 7-8)**
**Goal:** Learn how to build REST APIs in Go.

❌ `net/http` for building web servers
❌ Routing & middleware (using **Gin** or **Echo**)
❌ Handling requests, responses, and JSON
❌ Working with databases (**PostgreSQL or MySQL** via `database/sql` or **GORM**)
❌ Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
❌ Writing integration tests for APIs

📚 **Resources**:
- [Gin Web Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [GORM - Go ORM](https://gorm.io/)

🚀 **Project:**
- Build a **CRUD API for a TODO App** with user authentication.

---

### **📌 Phase 5: Advanced Go (Week 9-10)**
**Goal:** Learn about advanced topics in Go.

❌ Understanding Go internals (compilation, memory layout)
❌ Creating CLI applications (using `cobra`)
❌ Writing highly concurrent applications
❌ Using `protobuf` and gRPC for microservices
❌ Exploring event-driven architecture with Kafka/RabbitMQ
❌ Debugging and profiling (`pprof`, `delve`)

📚 **Resources**:
- [GopherCon Talks](https://www.youtube.com/c/GopherCon)

🚀 **Project:**
- Build a **CLI tool** that automates a task (e.g., backup manager, file organizer).

---

### **📌 Phase 6: Mastery & Real-world Projects (Week 11+)**
**Goal:** Work on complex applications, open-source contributions, and best practices.

❌ Work with **Docker** & **Kubernetes** to deploy Go apps
❌ Write Go services with microservices architecture
❌ Contribute to an open-source Go project
❌ Study **best practices and design patterns** in Go

🚀 **Final Projects:**
- Develop a **real-world SaaS application** in Go
- Build a **high-performance data processing service**
