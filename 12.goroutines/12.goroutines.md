📌 Lesson 12: Goroutines – Lightweight Concurrency in Go

1️⃣ Introduction

One of Go’s defining features is concurrency made simple through goroutines — lightweight, managed threads of execution.

Unlike OS threads, goroutines are:
•	Cheap to start (thousands are fine)
•	Managed by Go’s runtime scheduler
•	Built to support modern, parallel applications out-of-the-box

⸻

2️⃣ Core Concepts

🔹 What is a Goroutine?

A goroutine is created by prefixing a function call with the go keyword:

go sayHello()

This runs sayHello() asynchronously — it won’t block the caller.

⸻

🔹 Example: Basic Goroutine

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello()
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // let the goroutine finish
    fmt.Println("Main function done")
}
```

⚠️ Without the time.Sleep, the program would exit before sayHello() runs.

⸻

🔹 Anonymous Goroutines

```go
go func(msg string) {
    fmt.Println("Message:", msg)
}("from closure")
```

⸻

3️⃣ Practical Example

You can use goroutines for:
-	Parallel HTTP requests
-	Concurrent file processing
-	Handling multiple connections in servers

⸻

4️⃣ Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- ✅ Use go to parallelize independent tasks
- ✅ Use synchronization tools (next lesson: channels) to coordinate safely
- ❌ Don’t assume goroutines will complete unless you wait
- ❌ Avoid sharing memory without protection (use channels or mutex)

⸻

5️⃣ Hands-on Exercise

👉 Challenge: Write a program that:
1.	Launches 3 goroutines, each printing:
    -	"Routine X: Hello!" (where X is 1–3)
2.	The main function waits long enough to let them all finish

Output should look like (order may vary):

Routine 1: Hello!
Routine 2: Hello!
Routine 3: Hello!
Main function done

Use `time.Sleep()` just for this example — we’ll learn better ways (like `sync.WaitGroup`) in the next lessons.
